# Solidity-via-CryptoZombies
My entire journey of learning Solidity via CryptoZombies!

## Level 1
### I learnt:
* How to write Ethereum smart contracts.
* Programming in Solidity, Ethereum's smart contract programming language
* Building games on Ethereum.
* And finally create a solidity program to generate random zombie.
