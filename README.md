# Solidity-via-CryptoZombies
My entire journey of learning Solidity via CryptoZombies!

## Level 1
### I learnt:
* How to write Ethereum smart contracts.
* Programming in Solidity, Ethereum's smart contract programming language
* Building games on Ethereum.
* And finally create a solidity program to generate random zombie. 
* Try it out [here!](https://share.cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/1/share/hybrid?id=Y3p8NTM5NTY1)


## Level 2
### I learnt:
* The basics of making a multi-player game
* Interacting with other contracts on the Ethereum network
* Organizing larger Solidity projects into multiple contracts
* And finally built a Zombie Card Battle  
* Try it out [here!](https://share.cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/2/share/hybrid?id=Y3p8NTM5NTY1)


## Level 3
### I learnt some advanced concepts:
* How to build updatable smart contracts
* Securing contracts with contract ownership
* Gas and gas optimization on Ethereum
* Function modifiers and security checks  
* Try it out [here!](https://share.cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/3/share/hybrid?id=Y3p8NTM5NTY1)


## Level 4
### Fun to learn alot of real world applications
* Payable functions, and how to earn money from your Ethereum-based games
* Withdrawing ETH from smart contracts
* Random number generation & Security on Ethereum
* Code refactoring exploring modifiers!
* [Here](https://share.cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/4/share/hybrid?id=WyJjenw1Mzk1NjUiLDIsMTRd) is the completion link!

## Level 5
### Wao! It was so much fun to learn about:
* Tokens, the ERC721 standard, and creating tradable tokens / assets
* Solidity libraries and how to use them
* The SafeMath library and preventing uint overflows and underflows
* Commenting your Solidity code and the natspec standard.
